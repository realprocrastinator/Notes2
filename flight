# Questions 2
- NASA teach Astronouts to not to panic is to have control through rigourous simulations
so that they are confident and highly competent about their jobs and they do not feel
nervious during the launch. what do control do we have for the flight

-feedback loop for the strengthing excercise: how do we know that I have done it correctly
and it will work?

- should I board the plane or not , not sure if I can make it ?

-still freeze out and get quite anxious when think about comming flight

-initial fight duration what length would be good, 3, 10 hours?

-commit to return flight as well, the risk of not being able to return
  how do I know that I am ready?


#=============================================================================
# Questions
-safty calculated by miles, not times, most risky part is take of and landing

-why flying does not feel safe at all, the mean of transport that passenger would scream

-clear aire turbulence,Sever turbulance really sarery

-Turbulance that is dangerous CB cloud, like wave can tip the plane over, Dihedral got
threshhold that can maintain stability , what if the external force is too severe that
would break the stability. 

-tight in the head and could not focus, mind being frozen and suspended

-jet stream speed increase and there is 145% increase in turbulance

-do not like the uncerntainty, turbulance expected to come any time or
even suprise you with a big one

-If other ppl board on the plane they wil be safe and okay , if I do it will not be
does that indicates that little ego has once died?

-Roller coaster effect of pushing thorugh live the best of yourself

# get out of your own movie
> name the object surround you as fast as possible
if you are in your own mind moive, proababily you are not able to call names
very fast

# Abstract point of No Return
> Pre determined decision , to do no matter what, even it kills you
  since the part that will tell you not to do it will find reasons to tell you not
  to do it, but since you have made decision with no reservation , that part will
  have no reason to intefere,so it will goes away, which makes you the author of this
  decision. it might go back and forth , but eventually it is fine.
> Image the best and worst sencenario

#=============================================================================
# Strength excercise
6-7 times perday go around for all phases, break each scenario into moments of 
pictures
> imagine a good moment of your life that you feel calm and safe
  associated black whtie image of the airplane during
  - Normal phase
  - Disaster scene (imagine, things happening in a magazine)
  - Panic feelings
> Erease the bad experience
  -run the original experience in black and white
  -run the backward version of the experience couple of times
  -run the original experience and backward experience side by side
  -run the backward experience one more
  -run the original experience one more and see how it feels now
